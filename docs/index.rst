Welcome to Spawn Wind's Documentation!
======================================

Spawn wind is designed for the specification and execution of large simulations sets of aeroelastic calculations for wind turbines. It uses Simmovation's `Spawn package <https://github.com/Simmovation/spawn>`_. It is particularly useful for executing IEC load calculations but can also be used for the generation of any set of simulations.

Spawn wind is set up to use NREL's FAST v7.0.2 but can be adapted to other versions of FAST and also other aeroelastic load calculation tools. Spawn wind executes FAST simulations based on FAST base input files but with parameter variations determined by a Spawn input definition file.
